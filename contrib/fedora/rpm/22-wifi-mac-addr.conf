# This sets defaults for Wi-Fi profiles to set a stable MAC address.
#
# Do not modify this file. You can hide/overwrite this file by placing a file
# to "/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/22-wifi-mac-addr.conf". You can also add
# configuration snippets with higher priority that override this setting (see
# `man 5 NetworkManager.conf` how to do that). Most importantly, this only sets
# default values for the profile. You can explicitly set the value for each
# profile, so that this default value is not used.
#
# For example, on some networks you could set
#
#   $ nmcli connection modify "$PROFILE" connection.stable-id '${CONNECTION}/${BOOT}'
#
# to generate a new identity per-profile and for each boot.
#
# Or
#
#   $ nmcli connection modify "$PROFILE" wifi.cloned-mac-address permanent
#
# to not get a generated MAC address when using this profile.
#
# See `man 5 nm-settings` for "wifi.cloned-mac-address" and "connection.stable-id".
